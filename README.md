### Checking the impact the RBA is having on house valuations in New South Wales. 

Data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank of Australia(RBA). Data spans 2011-2020.

Two simple regression models were tested. Predictor was the RBA overnight cash rate(captured at quarterly intervals).
The target was the mean value of housing stock owned by households in NSW.

Both models produced negative coefficients meaning as rates dropped house valuations rise.

There is nothing surprising about the result other than a curiosity around size of the coefficient. 

Data is not tested for stationarity and was not differenced or lagged.
